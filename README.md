# Zeek_log_anonymiser

### Bro/Zeek log parser and anonymiser

#### This file serves to parse Bro/Zeek logs and identify and anonymise Personally Identifiable Information (PII). As example data the bro logs of the UNSW-NB15 dataset [1] have been used.

The PII information is highlighted in the notebook. All funtions and the PII list can be found in helperfunctions.py and one line of each log file is displayed at the botom with the PII highlighted in red.
